            <p> My name is Alicia M. Begay,
            I was born in Gallup, New Mexico raised on the Navajo reservation
            know as Twin Buttes, located southwest of Gallup. As a member of the
            Navajo Nation my introduction includes my 4 clans (maternal and paternal).
            so here it goes.
            Ya'ta'hey, Haltsooi Dine' (Meadow People) nishli, Kinyaa'aanii bashishchiin
            (Towering HouseP People), Tl'aashchi'i (Red Cheek People) dashicheii, Tse'nahabilnii'
            (Sleep-Rock People)dashinali'.</p>

            <p> I am a mother, daugther, sister, aunt, and grandmother. My daughter is
            almost 13 yrs old, and is starting to put a new face on since she is now in
            middle school. I live near my mother and sister. My mother is the most amazing
            loving, supporting person I will ever know, she is my rock. Without her I would
            not be the person I am today! My sister I love dearly since she is my one and only.
            Thankfully she has 5 children that I adore just as much as
            I do my own. They all keep me on my toes especially my grandgirls whom are still
            babies, they keep me an awe for how they have changed our small family with growth
            and </p>
